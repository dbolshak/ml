While you are building a machine learning solution, you should answer, or at least keep in mind, the following questions:

    What question(s) am I trying to answer? Do I think the data collected can answer that question?

    What is the best way to phrase my question(s) as a machine learning problem?

    Have I collected enough data to represent the problem I want to solve?

    What features of the data did I extract, and will these enable the right predictions?

    How will I measure success in my application?

    How will the machine learning solution interact with other parts of my research or business product?

In scikit-learn, data is usually denoted with a capital X, while labels are denoted by a lowercase y. This is inspired by the standard formulation f(x)=y in mathematics, where x is the input to a function and y is the output. Following more conventions from mathematics, we use a capital X because the data is a two-dimensional array (a matrix) and a lowercase y because the target is a one-dimensional array (a vector).
